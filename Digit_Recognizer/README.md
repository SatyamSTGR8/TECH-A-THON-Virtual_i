We have integrated a Digit Recognizer in our Virtual 'i' feeling that, a blind person for his transactions has to rely on other people's honesty. Now he won't be afraid of getting tricked. He can himself easily get to know the amount of money he is dealing with. The role Virtual 'i' plays here is significant, but this idea of recognizing numbers or alphabets is not just limited to this. We can train the model similarly for alphabets, now a blind can read Books, Newspapers, Documents.
